Home Page:

Create Mega Draft form... include champions bool

after they click create w their options we redirect to a created megadraft lobby


Lobby Page:

lobby waits until 3 more people join and they pick a team, host auto joins left side team

more after this.....


Actual 2v2 Megadraft Page:
* megadraft for each opposing pair
* should have a bar at the bottom and top keeping track of picks
* should have mini pick bars that the other 2 players are making too
* need to be concerned with timeouts and randomly selecting cards....
